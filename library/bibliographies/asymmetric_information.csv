Design/methodology/approach A field experiment was conducted with 344 rural households/farmers in Heilongjiang and Jiangsu Provinces, China. DID model was used to evaluate farmers’ technology adoption with and without index insurance. Findings The results show that weather index insurance has a significant effect on the technology adoption of rural households; there is a regional difference in this effect between Heilongjiang and Jiangsu. Weather index insurance promotes technology adoption of rural households in Heilongjiang, while has limited impact on those in Jiangsu. Weather, planting scale and risk preference are also important factors influencing the technology adoption of rural households. Research limitations/implications This research is subject to some limitations. First, the experimental parameters are designed according to the actual situation to simulate reality, but the willingness in the experiment does not mean it will be put into action in reality. Second, due to the diversity of China’s climate, geography and economic environment, rural households are heterogeneous in rural China. Whether the conclusion can be generalized beyond the study area is naturally questionable. A study with more diverse samples is needed to gain a fuller understanding of index insurance’s effects on farmers in China.

Participation in the federally subsidized crop insurance program may be correlated with technology adoption and other various risk management practices. Existing studies indicate that the subsidized FCIP may disincentivize producers from utilizing technology as a risk management tool. Empirical results indicate that producers enrolled in federal crop insurance programs may be more likely to have adopted PATs earlier than producers who were not enrolled in the FCIP. This could indicate that producers may not view the FCIP as a substitute for other risk management options, or that these producers may not view these technologies in the same risk-reducing lens as they may view the FCIP.","2022-04-28","2023-12-13 13:59:26","2023-12-13 13:59:26","2023-12-13 13:59:26","","","","","","","","","","","","Purdue University Graduate School","","en","","thesis","","","hammer.purdue.edu","","DOI: 10.25394/PGS.19666332.v1","","C:\Users\ftsib\Zotero\storage\CKW6IMMM\Comstock - 2022 - THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT FARM SUPPORT PROGRAMS ON.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We test insurance schemes with different levels of risk coverage and premium subsidies and find that (1) all schemes significantly increase the degree of adoption of the higher yielding seed, (2) partial insurance schemes perform worse than full insurance, (3) weather index insurance with geographical basis risk performs no worse than indemnity insurance, and (4) premium subsidies significantly increase the adoption effect of indemnity insurance, but not that of index insurance.","2018","2023-12-13 13:58:45","2023-12-13 13:58:45","2023-12-13 13:58:45","96-120","","1","69","","","Insurance for Technology Adoption","","","","","","","en","© 2017 The Agricultural Economics Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1477-9552.12226","","C:\Users\ftsib\Zotero\storage\R5QTSUX9\Freudenreich and Mußhoff - 2018 - Insurance for Technology Adoption An Experimental.pdf; C:\Users\ftsib\Zotero\storage\LPADA6FK\1477-9552.html","","","Mexico; technology adoption; Insurance; risk aversion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An output distance function is employed and estimated together with an inefficiency effects model to capture the effects of CAP subsidies and farmer characteristics on farm efficiency. The model is applied to FADN data (period 1995–2004) of crop farms in Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. The study shows that the 10-year average technical efficiency is 64% in Germany, 76% in the Netherlands and 71% in Sweden. The average annual changes in technical efficiency are 0.1%, 0.4% and 2.3%, respectively. The share of crop subsidies in total subsidies has a negative impact on technical efficiency in Germany but a positive impact in Sweden, although insignificant in the Netherlands. The share of total subsidies in total farm revenues has negative impacts on technical efficiency in all three countries, consistent with income and insurance effects. Positive (negative) change in technical efficiency is mainly attributable to farm size (degree of specialisation) in Germany, and degree of specialisation (degree of subsidy dependence) in the Netherlands and Sweden.","2010","2023-12-13 13:57:31","2023-12-13 13:57:31","2023-12-13 13:57:31","545-564","","3","61","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2010 The Authors.

Specifically, first, it examines the economic and environmental factors affecting the willingness of farmers to contract crop insurance. Second, it reveals the relationship between having crop insurance and technical efficiency of crop producing farms. Design/methodology/approach Probit models of panel data are applied to explore the factors of insurance decisions. The relationship between efficiency and insurance is investigated with two-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model with double bootstrap using panel data for the 2001 to 2014 period. Findings The results of Probit model estimations show that the education, the size, the indebtedness of crop producing farms and the new two-scheme risk management system are in positive correlation, while the concentration of farming activity are in negative correlation with the crop insurance contracting. The estimations of two-stage DEA model reveal that crop producing farms with an agricultural insurance contract are more efficient than the farmers without using this risk management tool.

This article investigates how insurance affects technical efficiency and whether insurance alters the utilized input quantity to a riskier bundle using the Norwegian salmon farming industry as a case. The results illustrate that insurance has an enhancing effect on production and efficiency and changes the utilized input mix—a well-insured farmer uses more feed and less capital and labor than a less-insured farmer. When linking this to each input's risk profile, the results indicate that insurance will induce the use of the risk-increasing factor (feed) and reduce the use of the risk-decreasing factors (labor and capital)—thereby increasing production risk and indicating moral hazard.","2019","2023-12-13 13:56:20","2023-12-13 13:56:20","2023-12-13 13:56:20","367-375","","3","50","","","Moral hazard","","","","","","","en","© 2019 International Association of Agricultural Economists","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/agec.12490","","C:\Users\ftsib\Zotero\storage\ZTZNYCE8\Roll - 2019 - Moral hazard the effect of insurance on risk and .pdf; C:\Users\ftsib\Zotero\storage\XE8JTY6M\agec.html","","","O13; Technical efficiency; D24; Insurance; Moral hazard; D22; G22; Input bundle; Q22; Risk profile; Salmon aquaculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The contributions of resource use and total factor productivity to the output growth of these farms are also investigated. The analysis indicates moderate levels of technical efficiency and a considerable variation of efficiency ratings among Saskatchewan farms. The ownership status, composition of labor employed, participation in crop insurance and government income transfer programs, participation in Top Management Workshops, degree of specialization, level of intensification and mechanization of production, type of land used, and the farm debts account for differences in efficiency across wheat farms. Even though the productive efficiency of the farms has been increasing over time, the results show that technological progress was the main source of productivity and output growth during the study period.

Les auteurs ont aussi déterminé dans quelle mesure l'exploitation des ressources et la productivité totale des facteurs affectent la croissance de la production dans les exploitations concernées. L'analyse révéle un degré moyen d'efficacité technique et une variation considérable du rendement chez les agriculteurs de la Saskatchewan. La variation du rendement s'explique par divers facteurs comme le type de propriété, la composition de la main-d'œuvre, l'inscription aux programmes gouvernementaux d'assurance récolte et de transfert du revenu, la participation à des ateliers de gestion, le degré de spécialisation, le niveau d'industrialisation et de mécanisation de la production, le genre de terres cultivées et la dette de l'exploitant.

Design/methodology/approach The authors use an input-oriented data envelopment analysis approach (DEA) to estimate technical efficiency scores. The DEA is combined with the double bootstrap approach in Simar and Wilson (2007) to study factors that may affect technical efficiency. This method overcomes the traditional two-stage DEA approach frequently used in the efficiency literature. The authors thus research the role of insurance on rice efficiency production using this technique and sizeable field-level survey data from 376 rice farmers distributed in five provinces during the 2019 winter cycle in Ecuador. Findings Most uninsured rice farmers operate with increasing returns to scale, which means that farms improve their resource use efficiency by increasing their size. However, since scale efficiencies are relatively high, it appears that inefficiencies are explained by inadequate input use. Also, the authors find evidence that insured farmers have a negative relationship with technical efficiency in rice production. In other results, when exploring the influence of additional variables on efficiency, the authors find that parameters related to transplanting, high education, farm size and some locations are positive and statistically significant. Social implications The results of this work are relevant for policymakers interested in evaluating technology performance, risk management instruments and farm efficiency in an industry in a developing country such as rice production in Ecuador.
